## Storing & loading json data
**A pratice problem from *Python Crash Course* by Eric Matthes**

**Overview:**    
3 functions:  
- 1) get_stored_username checks if there is a username already stored in the json file.   
- 2) get_new_username prompts a new user for a username and stores it into the newly created file.  
- 3) greet_user (the main function) checks if a username exists or prompts a user to create one, then returns a personalized welcome message.
